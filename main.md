# What?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

<p align="left">
[OMERO](https://openmicroscopy.org/omero) is a microscopy image management platform.
It helps you **organize**, **access** and **archive** your data.

# Why?



## Microscopy data is big and complex

* Long experiments
* Data intensive microscopes (e.g. Light sheet)
* Complicated data (super-resolution, heterogenous data)


> We need to **organize** both data and metadata

# What's in it for you as a researcher?

## Access your data from anywhere

* Browse and build figures directly from the web
* With your tools (ImageJ / Fiji, Napari, QPath ...)
* Even once your student / post-doc is gone
* Easily share with data analysts


## Keeping data safe

Your microscopy data will be stored

- in the datacenter
- with onsite and offsite backups
- by data management professionals


## Now your data is [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

* **Findable** : through filenames, annotations, tags
* **Accessible** : publish & share from the web client
* **Interoperable** : download in a standard format
* **Re-usable** : tracked metadata

# How?
