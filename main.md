[OMERO](https://openmicroscopy.org/omero) is a microscopy data management tool.
It helps you **organize**, **access** and **archive** your data.

This tool will be made available as a centralized ressource in your institute

# Why?

## Microscopy data is big and complex

* Long experiments
* Screens
* Data intensive microscopes (e.g. Light sheet)
* Complicated data (super-res, speckle)

---------

> Need to **organize** both data and metadata


## Keeping data safe

Your microscopy data will be stored in the Datacenter with onsite and offsite backups.

## Keeping data accessible

* Access your data from anywhere
* From the web
* Or with your tools (ImageJ / Fiji, Napari, QPath ...)
* Even once your student / post-doc is gone
* Easily share with your data scientists collaborators


## Now your data is [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)


* **Findable** : through filenames, annotations, tags
* **Accessible** : publish & share from the web client
* **Interoperable** : download in a standard format
* **Re-usable** : tracked metadata

# How?
